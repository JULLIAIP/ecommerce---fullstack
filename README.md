# Vibbra Eccomerce
Desenvolvimento de um ecommerce que permite comprar, vender ou trocar produtos de tecnologia.

## Description
This project has the login and home screens completed. Additionally, on the login screen, we can access a registration form by clicking "Start a 14 day free trial" and on the home screen, by clicking on the "Negociações > Criar negociação" menu, we can access the form for creating a new negotiation.
In the backend, we have the tables designed, except for the freight table. Furthermore, we have all the routes configured, with their respective request methods as suggested in the documentation.

## Project status
This project is in progress, currently only the separate parts are working for testing purposes;
The screen flow on the homepage doesn't have triggers for back-end functions.

## Run
### To see the tables of the database, use the command: npx prisma studio.
### To run the front or the back end use the command : npm run dev
